gce-images-centos
=================

Description
-----------
Tools to roll your own CentOS image for Google Compute Engine.

Currently, I will be using 2 methods for building the images:

virt-builder
    Because it just works and it works great.

Goals
-----
* Build an image that is 100% compilant with GCE.
* Help you to build your own images however you think it's best.
